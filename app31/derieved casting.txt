In the same inheritance .. converting from one derieved data type to another data type.is called derieved casting.......

Under derieved datatypes there are 2 types of castings--
   1. Autoupcasting(automatically up casting)
   2. explicit downcasting.


Auto upcasting-->> while assigning a subclass type to super class we dont do  any kind of conversion compiler do automatically

Explicit downccasting-->> while assigning a super class to a subclass type .. then compiler dont provide any casting that we have to do
                          explicitely. that is explicit downcasting
