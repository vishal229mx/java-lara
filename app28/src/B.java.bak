interface B
{
}
//interface can become a java file
//every member of a java file become a class file while compiling
//for interface also java file is converted into class file

//by default every interface is 100% abstract usage of abstract key word is optional its not mandatory coz interface is already abstract

//inside a interface we cannot create any concrete members

// interface allows only constant and abstract methods___ no defined or concrete methods are allowed
