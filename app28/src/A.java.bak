//it is mandatory to have atleast one constructor in a class 
//if developer donot make then compiler by default make a no arg constructor as default constructor.

//constructor is always concrete
//you cannot make a constructor as a abstract.
//as a constructor cannot be inheriting to sub class.
//so a abstract constructor can never be called.
