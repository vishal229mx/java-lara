Assertions are introduced in JDK1.4


before jdk1.4 we were able to use assert as a identifier after jdk1.4 assert become keyword
there are two types of assert stmt available
1.very simple assert stmt(VSA)
  ex.. assert boolean_result;

2.simple assert stmt(sa)
  ex.. assert boolean_result : some_message;

By default no assert stmt is executing--
  in order to execute assert stmt we have to supply one VM(virtual Machine) argument-
     ex-
        -ea    (or)  -enableassertions ---->> command for enable asssert stmt


	-da    (or)  -disableassertions ----->> command for disabling assert stmts



	assert stmts enabling/disabling can be done in three different ways
	1. execution wise
	2. package and its sub packages wise
	3. class wise

Usage of assertion stmts--
1. to rise assertion error whenever business rule is getting failed...vary similar to throw keyword
we can use throw keyword for rising any type of exceptionn and we use assertion for rising assertion error.....

assertion is a error type 

Differences bt throw and assertion----------------
1. In throw there is no chance of disable or enable
    enabling and disabling rule for assert
2. Optional for some people and mandatory for some other people then go for asserts.
   to whom rule is optional let them run without arguments
   to whom rule is mandatory then run with arg(-ea)

3.By using throw keyword you can raise any error class name.
    in case of assert you can not specify class name.
     it can only raise one class that is assertion error.

4. throw stmt always should be the last stmt of the current block
    like break,continue,return stmts throw is the last stmt.

    assert can be anywhere in the block..
