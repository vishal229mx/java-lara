//we are increasing the usage of objects by using in multiple threads...
//always sharing an obhects to multiple of threads ... increase the scope or usage of the object // bt there is a limitation
//it is always possible that more than one thread using the same object simultaneously that causes ambiguity..



//if any mehtod is declared as a synchronized this mehtod is considered as closed mehtod to a thread..
//thread cannot enter into synchronized method straight away
//thread should req object lock ... through object lock it can enter into synchronized method 

//every obj will have one object lock...while object is creating ... object lock also creates for every possible usage of object..
//while creating an object to shared, A , B and main ... for every object there is respective object lock created.. 

//this problem is avoided through synchronized
