//we cannot change id of a thread

/*
for parent/main thread ..... its name is main
child threads -- >> thread_0
                      thread_1
					  thread_2 etc.
 we can read name of the thread ... here return type of name of thread is string type
There are two ways to modify name of a thread--
    1.through setName()
	2.through constructor

*/

/*
Every child thread in java by default a user thread thats why daemon is false
 but isDaemon() return type is boolean
 when we convert user thread into daemon thread then its value will be true
 --- there is a way to convert user thread to daemon thrread is "through setDaemon()"
*/

/*
Priority-
priority is a integer number between 1 to 10
min priority-1 and max priority-10,, 5- normal priority
we can modify the priority through "setPriority()"
default value of priority is 5 i.e. normal priority
