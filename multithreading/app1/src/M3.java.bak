//from a thread class several mthods are inheriting to A
//among all the method run method we are overriding.
//while creating a object to A class a thread is creating..
//eventhough thread is creating that thread is not knowing to the thread schedullar
//for that purpose we have to call the start() ... 
//thread is register in the thread schedullar .. allocating to execute and run through start()..



//thread is available in the java.lang package
//it is a non final class we can develop sub classes to thread class
//there are several methods in the thread class..we are all inheriting in the A class from that 2 imp methods are run and start
//we are overriding run mehtod 
//while creating object to A class thread is creating to A that means main become parent thread and A class is child thread
//in the body of the start()... a1 thread registering and schedulling to the thread schedular...
