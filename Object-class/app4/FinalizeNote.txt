Finalize()


//finalize() method is a protected method 
//it should be used in the in  the sub class .. it cannot be used outside of the sub class
//it is executing by garbage collector 
//when it is executing-->>whenever object is removing from the memory finalize() executing by garbage collector
//when object is removing / which obj is eligible to remove??
//when object is becoming abondant then that object is eligible for garbage collection..
//garbage collector removing that abondant object from the memory by calling finalize()..
//which object is called as abondant-->> if obj doesnt have even a single referance variable then that is called as abondant obj.
//live obj.-->> min. one ref variable.....//abondant obj.-->> no ref.variables
//object class containing finalize()... that is available in every class... same is available in all object...
//garbage collector once in a while coming to the heap memory..scanning entire heap memory for any abondant memory
//if any abondant memory is available in the heap memory .. calling finalize() and removing from the memory


-->>whenever last reference is removed at that time object is becoming abondant..
-->>when object is removing by garbage collector---->>>> 
we can not estimate when object is removing from the memory it is very uncertain 
garbage collector coming to the memory once in a while to remove abondant obj from the memory

//there is a way to making a request to garbage collector
//if we make req. to garbage collector it may came immediately or
  it may take sometime we cannot estimate when the garbage collector came for object removal

//On any object,,garbage collector calling finalize method only max one time.. not more than one time-->>


//if any abondant object got ressuracted while finalize() scanning for any abondant object and that ressuracted object doesnnt get
removed.. and when next time garbage colector scanns for abondant object and that same object finds as abondant... then finalize() doesnot calls
for that same object... that object will not be removed by garbage collector itself
